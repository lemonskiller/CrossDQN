# CrossDQN

This repository is the implementation of CrossCDN.

## Required packages

The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.9, with the following packages installed (along with their dependencies):
- tensorflow==1.14.0
- numpy==1.17.3
- scikit-learn==0.21.3

##  Run the code

Due to data sensitivity, we only provide a data demo in tfrecord format, but the model code can be well applied to the same scenario.

```
$ cd src
$ python main.py
```
